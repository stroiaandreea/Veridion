The company, which grew out of a desire to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and air pollutants, has developed a patented Prosto vertical axis direct-coupled wind turbine technology. This technology is designed to be more efficient, maintainable, and environmentally friendly compared to traditional horizontal axis wind turbines. The Prosto turbines are scalable, modular, and can be transported in modules without requiring special permits. They are also low noise and have minimal visual impact. Since its inception, Prosto has installed over 2 MW of power in Poland and has additional projects under development in Canada, the U.S., the Caribbean, and Asia. The company provides full technical support and training for its systems.",Patented Vertical Axis Direct-coupled Technology | Electric Generator | Renewable Energy Development | Technical Support | Patented Vertical Axis Wind Turbine | Training for Installers,"Prosto Wind Turbines provides full technical support through all phases of a project, and each system includes a full training package for installers, operators, & maintenance personnel.","Next generation wind turbines have an efficiency coefficient of 65%+, with unique energy storage capabilities via proprietary compressed air storage systems. Prosto Vertical Axis Wind Turbines can be scaled and tailored to suit any application. A single turbine produces 11.1kWph whilst three turbines will produce enough power for the standard US family home. The scalable and modular design makes it simple and easy to transport individual segments, generators, and other components. Transportation and logistics for horizontal wind turbine energy projects is a complicated process due to the massive size of turbines, blades, generators and nacelles. The patented technology uses harmonic distortions, capacitance, resistance, and inductive finger prints matched with intelligent algorithms to accomplish definite forecasts.
